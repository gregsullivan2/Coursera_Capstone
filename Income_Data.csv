1. Per capita personal income was computed using Census Bureau midyear population estimates. Estimates reflect county population estimates available as of March 2019.,,,,,,,
"2. The personal income level shown for the United States is derived as the sum of the county estimates. It differs from the estimate of personal income in the national income and product accounts because of differences in coverage, in the methodologies used to prepare the estimates, and in the timing of the availability of source data.",,,,,,,
