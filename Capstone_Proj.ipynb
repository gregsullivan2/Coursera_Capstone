    "As a young professional on the job market, I have recently realized the huge discrepancy in housing prices in cities around the United States.  Typically, the markets with the higher housing rates are also the markets with the higher jobs.  I would like to filter through the data to find which cities I would best be able to buy a house.  It is important to note that salary vs. housing cost is not the only factor considered to find the best cities to move to; happiness is probably the most important factor when looking for a place to move. <br/> <br/>\n",
    "The goal of this project is to build a notebook that helps the user rank potential places to live.  The intended user is anyone who is looking to move to a city within the United States. <br/> <br/>\n",
    "Inherently, some very important factors will be left out of this analysis.  For example, where family and friends live is not taken into account.  The local school system is another major factor not considered in this analysis which many users would consider crucial."
